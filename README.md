# i3-castle
This is the set of configuration files I use for my [i3 window manager] [1] setup.

Feel free to scavange these configs for snippets that work for you.

## Neat Features (i3)
- hitting both alt keys gives you power commands (lock, suspend, ...).
- windows and status bar use the same default font as sublime text which is neat if you like that font.
- runs some indicators like nm-applet, redshift, tomate, ...
- binds volume control keys to pulseaudio pactl command.
- defines a neat binding `mod+a` opens selected text in chromium app mode for maximum screen real estate.
- binds `mod+c` to starting or stopping a [screencast] [2].

## Neat Features (i3status)
- shows the date and time in an easy to digest format.
- prints battery info with a pretty charging icon (unicode).
- indicates whether or not a [screencast] [2] is being recorded.

This repository is designed to work with [homeshick] [3].
